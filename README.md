#WELCOME!
Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.


#The challenge
 To create a web app(Use Reactjs) to display information about only
countries in asia (look for ‘Region’ section in rest api docs) by consuming a rest api and
displaying the data. Show Button to refresh data from rest api.
● Display following attributes - name, capital, flag(display image for each country), region,
subregion, population, borders & languages.
● Rest API docs - https://restcountries.eu

#Building project
Initialize your project as a public repository on GitHub. This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, have a read through of this Try Git resource.
Configure your repository to publish your code to a URL. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, but we recommend using Vercel. We've got more information about deploying your project with Vercel below.
Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.
Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as font-family and font-size.
Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
